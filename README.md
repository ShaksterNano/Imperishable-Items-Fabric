# Imperishable Items Fabric

Adds an enchantment that prevents the item it's on from despawning or being destroyed. Additionally, if a tool with this enchantment reaches 0 durability, it won't break, but it will lose any special properties instead. Repairing the tool will restore those properties. For example, a pickaxe with this enchantment at 0 durability will lose it's increased mining speed. What the enchantment protects against can be configured. This mod is required on both the client and the server. Requires the [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric "Fabric API").
